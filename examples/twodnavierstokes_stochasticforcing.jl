# # [2D forced-dissipative turbulence](@id twodnavierstokes_stochasticforcing_example)
#
# A simulation of forced-dissipative two-dimensional turbulence. We solve the
# two-dimensional vorticity equation with stochastic excitation and dissipation in
# the form of linear drag and hyperviscosity. 
#
# ## Install dependencies
#
# First let's make sure we have all required packages installed.

# ```julia
# using Pkg
# pkg"add GeophysicalFlows, CUDA, CairoMakie"
# ```

# ## Let's begin
# Let's load `GeophysicalFlows.jl` and some other packages we need.

# First, we pick some numerical and physical parameters for our model.

# ## Forcing

# We force the vorticity equation with stochastic excitation that is delta-correlated in time 
# and while spatially homogeneously and isotropically correlated. The forcing has a spectrum 
# with power in a ring in wavenumber space of radius ``k_f`` (`forcing_wavenumber`) and width 
# ``δ_f`` (`forcing_bandwidth`), and it injects energy per unit area and per unit time 
# equal to ``\varepsilon``. That is, the forcing covariance spectrum is proportional to 
# ``\exp{[-(|\bm{k}| - k_f)^2 / (2 δ_f^2)]}``.

forcing_wavenumber = 14.0 * 2π/L  # the forcing wavenumber, `k_f`, for a spectrum that is a ring in wavenumber space
forcing_bandwidth  = 1.5  * 2π/L  # the width of the forcing spectrum, `δ_f`
ε = 0.1                           # energy input rate by the forcing

grid = TwoDGrid(dev; nx=n, Lx=L)

K = @. sqrt(grid.Krsq)             # a 2D array with the total wavenumber

forcing_spectrum = @. exp(-(K - forcing_wavenumber)^2 / (2 * forcing_bandwidth^2))
@CUDA.allowscalar forcing_spectrum[grid.Krsq .== 0] .= 0 # ensure forcing has zero domain-average

ε0 = parsevalsum(forcing_spectrum .* grid.invKrsq / 2, grid) / (grid.Lx * grid.Ly)
@. forcing_spectrum *= ε/ε0        # normalize forcing to inject energy at rate ε

# Next we construct function `calcF!` that computes a forcing realization every timestep.
# For that, we call `randn!` to obtain complex numbers whose real and imaginary part
# are normally-distributed with zero mean and variance 1/2.

# ## Problem setup
# We initialize a `Problem` by providing a set of keyword arguments. The
# `stepper` keyword defines the time-stepper to be used.

# First let's see how a forcing realization looks like. Function `calcF!()` computes 
# the forcing in Fourier space and saves it into variable `vars.Fh`, so we first need to
# go back to physical space.

# Note that when plotting, we decorate the variable to be plotted with `Array()` to make sure 
# it is brought back on the CPU when the variable lives on the GPU.
