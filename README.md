This package leverages the [FourierFlows.jl] framework to provide modules for solving problems in
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics on periodic domains using Fourier-based pseudospectral methods.


## Installation

To install, use Julia's  built-in package manager (accessed by pressing `]` in the Julia REPL command prompt) to add the package and also to instantiate/build all the required dependencies

```julia
julia>]
(v1.5) pkg> add GeophysicalFlows
(v1.5) pkg> instantiate
```

The most recent version of GeophysicalFlows.jl requires Julia v1.5 or later.

GeophysicalFlows.jl v0.8.5 is the last version compatible with Julia v1.4.

The latest version that is compatible with Julia v1.0.5 (the current long-term-release) is GeophysicalFlows.jl v0.5.1.


## Examples

See `examples/` for example scripts. These examples are best viewed by browsing them within 
the package's [documentation]. 

Some animations created with GeophysicalFlows.jl are [online @ youtube].


## Modules

* `TwoDNavierStokes`: the two-dimensional vorticity equation.
* `SingleLayerQG`: the barotropic or equivalent-barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation, which 
  generalizes `TwoDNavierStokes` to cases with topography, Coriolis parameters of the form 
  `f = f₀ + βy`, and finite Rossby radius of deformation.
* `MultiLayerQG`: a multi-layer quasi-geostrophic model over topography and with the ability 
  to impose a zonal flow `U_n(y)` in each layer.
* `SurfaceQG`: a surface quasi-geostrophic model.
* `BarotropicQGQL`: the quasi-linear barotropic quasi-geostrophic equation.


## Scalability

For now, GeophysicalFlows.jl is restricted to run on either a single CPU or single GPU. These
restrictions come from FourierFlows.jl. Multi-threading can enhance performance for the Fourier
transforms. By default, FourierFlows.jl will use the maximum number of threads available on 
your machine. You can set the number of threads used by FourierFlows.jl by setting the 
environment variable, e.g.,

```
$ export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
```

For more information on multi-threading users are directed to the [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/).

If your machine has more than one GPU available, then functionality within CUDA.jl package 
enables the user to choose the GPU device that FourierFlows.jl should use. The user is referred
to the [CUDA.jl Documentation](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/stable/lib/driver/#Device-Management);
in particular, [`CUDA.devices`](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/stable/lib/driver/#CUDA.devices) 
and [`CUDA.CuDevice`](https://juliagpu.github.io/CUDA.jl/stable/lib/driver/#CUDA.CuDevice). 
The user is also referred to the [GPU section](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/gpu/) in the FourierFlows.jl documentation.
