# MultiLayerQG


### From continuous to discrete

Under the quasi-geostrophic approximation with stratified dynamics both the horizontal flow, ``u(x, y, z, t)``, 
``v(x, y, z, t)``, and the buoyancy ``b(x, y, z, t)`` are obtained via a streamfunction ``\psi(x, y, z, t)``:

```math
\begin{aligned}
  u &=   - \partial_y \psi , \\
  v &=     \partial_x \psi , \\
  b &= f_0 \partial_z \psi .
\end{aligned}
```

The dynamics are determined from the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV)

```math
\begin{aligned}
  q &= \partial_x v - \partial_y u + \partial_z \left( \frac{f_0}{N^2} b \right) , \\
    &= (\partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2) \psi + \partial_z \left( \frac{f_0^2}{N^2} \partial_z \psi \right) .
\end{aligned}
```

where ``N^2 = - \rho_0^{-1} g \, \mathrm{d} \rho / \mathrm{d}z`` is the square of the Brunt-V√§is√§l√§ frequency,
where ``\rho_0`` is a reference density and ``g`` the gravitational constant.

To go from the continuous (in ``z``) dynamics above to a discrete dynamics we can integrate all
quantities over the height of each fluid layer.
An alternative is to replace the vertical derivatives that appear both in the buoyancy definition and
in the Brunt-V√§is√§l√§ frequency with a discrete approximation.

We use subscripts ``j`` to denote quantities that are constant within each fluid layer. For example,
the heights of each fluid layer are ``H_j``, ``j = 1, \dots, n``, where ``n`` is the number of fluid
layers. Also, ``\rho_j`` is the density of each layer and ``\psi_j`` and ``q_j`` the streamfunction 
and QGPV associated with that fluid layer.

The buoyancy is associated with the fluid interfaces. We use semi-integer subscript values to denote a
fluid interface, e.g., ``b_{5/2}`` is the buoyancy that corresponds to the interface between fluid layers
2 and 3. Thus, from the relationship that connects buoyancy ``b`` and streamfunction ``\psi`` we approximate
the buoyancies at each interface as

```math
b_{j+1/2} = f_0 \frac{\psi_j - \psi_{j+1}}{(H_j + H_{j+1})/2} .
```

Above we divided the difference of streamfunction at the two layers with the distance between the
center of the two layers, ``(H_j + H_{j+1})/2``.

Similarly, since the Brunt-V√§is√§l√§ frequency is proportional to the ``z``-derivative of the density,
it also corresponds to the fluid interfaces, i.e.,

```math
N^2_{j+1/2} = - \frac{g}{\rho_0} \frac{\rho_j - \rho_{j+1}}{(H_j + H_{j+1})/2} .
```

Combining the above we have that the vortex stretching term for the ``j``-th layer is

```math
\begin{aligned}
\left . \partial_z \left( \frac{f_0}{N^2} b \right) \right |_{j} & = \frac{1}{H_j} \left( \frac{f_0}{N^2_{j-1/2}} b_{j-1/2} - \frac{f_0}{N^2_{j+1/2}} b_{j+1/2} \right ) \\
& = \frac{1}{H_j} \left[ \dfrac{f_0}{- \frac{g}{\rho_0} \frac{\rho_{j-1} - \rho_{j}}{(H_{j-1}+H_{j})/2}} f_0 \frac{\psi_{j-1} - \psi_{j}}{(H_{j-1}+H_{j})/2}  - \dfrac{f_0}{- \frac{g}{\rho_0} \frac{\rho_j - \rho_{j+1}}{(H_j+H_{j+1})/2}}  f_0 \frac{\psi_j - \psi_{j+1}}{(H_j+H_{j+1})/2} \right ] \\
& = \frac{1}{H_j} \left[\dfrac{f_0^2}{g \frac{\rho_j - \rho_{j-1} }{\rho_0}} (\psi_{j-1} - \psi_j) - \dfrac{f_0^2}{g \frac{\rho_{j+1} - \rho_j}{\rho_0}} (\psi_j - \psi_{j+1})  \right ] \\
& = \dfrac{f_0^2}{g'_{j-1/2} H_j} (\psi_{j-1} - \psi_j) - \dfrac{f_0^2}{g'_{j+1/2} H_j} (\psi_j - \psi_{j+1})  ,
\end{aligned}
```

where above we defined the reduced gravity that corresponds to the ``j+1/2`` interface

```math
  g'_{j+1/2} = g \frac{\rho_{j+1} - \rho_j}{\rho_0} .
```

So the reduced gravity has the reference density ``\rho_0`` in the denominator. One can use
the mean density as the reference density, e.g.,

```math
\rho_0 = \sum_{j} \rho_j H_j \big / \sum_j H_j

### Basic Equations

This module solves the layered quasi-geostrophic equations on a beta plane of variable fluid 
depth ``H - h(x, y)``. The flow in each layer is obtained through a streamfunction ``\psi_j`` as 
``(u_j, v_j) = (-\partial_y \psi_j, \partial_x \psi_j)``, ``j = 1, \dots, n``, where ``n`` 
is the number of fluid layers.

The QGPV in each layer is

```math
\mathrm{QGPV}_j = q_j + \underbrace{f_0 + \beta y}_{\textrm{planetary PV}} + \delta_{j, n} \underbrace{\frac{f_0 h}{H_n}}_{\textrm{topographic PV}}, \quad j = 1, \dots, n .
```

where ``q_j`` incorporates the relative vorticity in each layer ``\nabla^2 \psi_j`` and the vortex stretching terms:

```math
\begin{aligned}
  q_1 &= \nabla^2 \psi_1 + F_{3/2, 1} (\psi_2 - \psi_1), \\
  q_j &= \nabla^2 \psi_j + F_{j-1/2, j} (\psi_{j-1} - \psi_j) + F_{j+1/2, j} (\psi_{j+1} - \psi_j) , \quad j = 2, \dots, n-1, \\
  q_n &= \nabla^2 \psi_n + F_{n-1/2, n} (\psi_{n-1} - \psi_n).
\end{aligned}
```

with

```math
F_{j+1/2, k} = \frac{f_0^2}{g'_{j+1/2} H_k} .
```

In view of the relationships above, when we convert to Fourier space ``q``'s and ``\psi``'s are 
related via the matrix equation

```math
\begin{pmatrix}
  \widehat{q}_{ùê§, 1} \\
  \vdots             \\
  \widehat{q}_{ùê§, n}
\end{pmatrix} =
\underbrace{\left(-|ùê§|^2 \mathbb{1} + \mathbb{F} \right)}_{\equiv \mathbb{S}_{ùê§}}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \widehat{\psi}_{ùê§, 1} \\
  \vdots                \\
  \widehat{\psi}_{ùê§, n}
\end{pmatrix}
```

where

```math
\mathbb{F} \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
  -F_{3/2, 1} &          F_{3/2, 1}        &      0     &    \cdots    &       0       \\
   F_{3/2, 2} & -(F_{3/2, 2} + F_{5/2, 2}) & F_{5/2, 2} &              &    \vdots     \\
      0       &           \ddots           &   \ddots   &    \ddots    &               \\
    \vdots    &                            &            &              &       0       \\
      0       &           \cdots           &      0     & F_{n-1/2, n} & -F_{n-1/2, n}
\end{pmatrix} .
```

Including an imposed zonal flow ``U_j(y)`` in each layer, the equations of motion are:

```math
\partial_t q_j + \mathsf{J}(\psi_j, q_j ) + (U_j - \partial_y\psi_j) \partial_x Q_j +  U_j \partial_x q_j  + (\partial_y Q_j)(\partial_x \psi_j) = -\delta_{j, n} \mu \nabla^2 \psi_n - \nu (-1)^{n_\nu} \nabla^{2 n_\nu} q_j ,
```

with

```math
\begin{aligned}
  \partial_x Q_j &\equiv \delta_{j, n} \partial_x \eta .
  \partial_y Q_j &\equiv \beta - \partial_y^2 U_j - (1 - \delta_{j, 1}) F_{j-1/2, j} (U_{j-1} - U_j) - (1 - \delta_{j,n}) F_{j+1/2, j} (U_{j+1} - U_j) + \delta_{j, n} \partial_y \eta , \\
\end{aligned}
```


### Implementation

Matrices ``\mathbb{S}_{ùê§}`` as well as ``\mathbb{S}^{-1}_{ùê§}`` are included in `params` as 
`params.S` and `params.S‚Åª¬π` respectively. Additionally, the background PV gradients 
``\partial_x Q`` and ``\partial_y Q`` are also included in the `params` under `params.Qx` and 
`params.Qy`.

One can get the ``\widehat{\psi}_j`` from ``\widehat{q}_j`` via  `streamfunctionfrompv!(œàh, qh, params, grid)`,
while the inverse, i.e., obtain ``\widehat{q}_j`` from ``\widehat{\psi}_j``, is done via
`pvfromstreamfunction!(qh, œàh, params, grid)`.

The equations of motion are time-stepped forward in Fourier space:

```math
  \partial_t \widehat{q}_j = - \widehat{\mathsf{J}(\psi_j, q_j)} - \widehat{U_j \partial_x Q_j} - \widehat{U_j \partial_x q_j}
  + \widehat{(\partial_y \psi_j) \partial_x Q_j} - \widehat{(\partial_x \psi_j)(\partial_y Q_j)} + \delta_{j, n} \mu |ùê§|^{2} \widehat{\psi}_n - \nu |ùê§|^{2n_\nu} \widehat{q}_j .
```

In doing so the Jacobian is computed in the conservative form: ``\mathsf{J}(f, g) =
\partial_y [ (\partial_x f) g] - \partial_x[ (\partial_y f) g]``.

The state variable `sol` consists of the Fourier transforms of ``q_j`` at each layer, i.e., 
[`qh`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.Vars).

The linear operator is constructed in `Equation`

```@docs
GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.Equation
GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.hyperviscosity
```

The nonlinear terms are computed via

```@docs
GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.calcN!
```

which in turn calls [`calcN_advection!`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.calcN_advection!) 
and [`addforcing!`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.addforcing!).

!!! tip "Linearized MultiLayerQG dynamics"
    The `MultiLayerQG` module includes also version of the dynamics that is linearized about a base
    flow ``U_j(y)``, ``j = 1, \dots, n``; see [`LinearEquation`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.LinearEquation), 
    [`calcNlinear!`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.calcNlinear!), and 
    [`calcN_linearadvection!`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.calcN_linearadvection!).


### Parameters and Variables

All required parameters are gathered in [`Params`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.Params)
and all module variables are found in [`Vars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.Vars).

For a problem without any forcing (``F = 0``), `vars` is constructed with [`DecayingVars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.DecayingVars).
For the forced problems (``F \ne 0``) the `vars` is constructed either via [`ForcedVars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.ForcedVars) when the forcing is deterministic or via [`StochasticForcedVars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.MultiLayerQG.StochasticForcedVars) when the forcing is stochastic.
