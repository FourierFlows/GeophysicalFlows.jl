# SingleLayerQG

### Basic Equations

This module solves the barotropic or equivalent-barotropic quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation
on a beta plane of variable fluid depth ``H - h(x, y)``. The flow is obtained through a
streamfunction ``\psi`` as ``(u, v) = (-\partial_y \psi, \partial_x \psi)``. All flow fields
can be obtained from the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV). Here, the QGPV is

```math
    \underbrace{f_0 + \beta y}_{\text{planetary PV}} + \underbrace{\partial_x v
    - \partial_y u}_{\text{relative vorticity}}
    \underbrace{ - \frac{1}{\ell^2} \psi}_{\text{vortex stretching}} +
    \underbrace{\frac{f_0 h}{H}}_{\text{topographic PV}} ,
```

where ``\ell`` is the Rossby radius of deformation. Purely barotropic dynamics corresponds to
infinite Rossby radius of deformation (``\ell = \infty``), while a flow with a finite Rossby
radius follows is said to obey equivalent-barotropic dynamics. We denote the sum of the relative
vorticity and the vortex stretching contributions to the QGPV with ``q \equiv \nabla^2 \psi - \psi / \ell^2``.
Also, we denote the topographic PV with ``\eta \equiv f_0 h / H``.

The dynamical variable is ``q``. Including an imposed zonal flow ``U(y)``, the equation of motion is:

```math
\partial_t q + \mathsf{J}(\psi, q) + (U - \partial_y \psi) \partial_x Q +  U \partial_x q + (\partial_y Q)(\partial_x \psi) = \underbrace{-\left[\mu + \nu(-1)^{n_\nu} \nabla^{2n_\nu} \right] q}_{\textrm{dissipation}} + F ,
```

with

```math
\begin{aligned}
\partial_y Q & \equiv \beta - \partial_y^2 U + \partial_y \eta , \\
\partial_x Q & \equiv \partial_x \eta ,
\end{aligned}
```

the background PV gradient components, and with
``\mathsf{J}(a, b) = (\partial_x a)(\partial_y b) - (\partial_y a)(\partial_x b)``
the two-dimensional Jacobian. On the right hand side, ``F(x, y, t)`` is forcing, ``\mu`` is
linear drag, and ``\nu`` is hyperviscosity of order ``n_\nu``. Plain old viscosity corresponds
to ``n_\nu = 1``.

If the imposed background zonal flow is constant over the whole domain (doesn't depend on ``y``),
the above simplifies to:

```math
\partial_t q + \mathsf{J}(\psi, q + \eta) + U \partial_x (q + \eta) + Œ≤ \partial_x \psi = \underbrace{-\left[\mu + \nu(-1)^{n_\nu} \nabla^{2n_\nu} \right] q}_{\textrm{dissipation}} + F ,
```

and thus the mean advection of ``q`` by ``U`` is incorporated in the linear term ``L``.

### Implementation

The equation is time-stepped forward in Fourier space:

```math
\partial_t \widehat{q} = - \widehat{\mathsf{J}(\psi, q)} - \widehat{U \partial_x Q} - \widehat{U \partial_x q}
  + \widehat{(\partial_y \psi) (\partial_x Q)}  - \widehat{(\partial_x \psi)(\partial_y Q)}
  - \left(\mu + \nu |ùê§|^{2n_\nu} \right) \widehat{q} + \widehat{F} .
```

In doing so the Jacobian is computed in the conservative form: ``\mathsf{J}(f, g) =
\partial_y [(\partial_x f) g] - \partial_x [(\partial_y f) g]``.

The state variable `sol` is the Fourier transform of the sum of relative vorticity and vortex
stretching (when the latter is applicable), [`qh`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.Vars).

The linear operator is constructed in `Equation`

```@docs
GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.Equation
```

The nonlinear terms are computed via

```@docs
GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.calcN!
```

which in turn calls [`calcN_advection!`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.calcN_advection!)
and [`addforcing!`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.addforcing!).


### Parameters and Variables

All required parameters are included inside [`Params`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.Params)
and all module variables are included inside [`Vars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.Vars).

For the decaying case (no forcing, ``F = 0``), variables are constructed with [`Vars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.Vars).
For the forced case (``F \ne 0``) variables are constructed with either [`ForcedVars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.ForcedVars)
or [`StochasticForcedVars`](@ref GeophysicalFlows.SingleLayerQG.StochasticForcedVars).
